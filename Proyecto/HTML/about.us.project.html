			<td>Wether you're passionate about animal welfare or simply want to make a possitive impact, there are many ways you can get involved. Here's How!:
				<ul>
					<li><h2>1. Adopt a pet</h2></li>By adopting a stray or abandoned animal, you not only provide them with a loving home, but also help up free up space for another animal in need. You can check out our adoption page to see our current animals looking for their forever families.
					<li><h2>2. Foster a pet</h2></li>As a foster parent, you provide a safe and caring enviroment until the animal is ready for adoption. If you're unable to adopt but still want to help, this might just be the best option for you.
					<li><h2>3. Volunteer</h2></li>Wether it's helping at adoption events, walking dogs, or assisting with administrative tasks, your time can make a TON of difference. Volunteering allows us to further spread the word and work more efficiently, we can save more strays by the day!
					<li><h2>4. Donate</h2></li>Your generous donations allow us to provide food, medical care, and shelter to the amimals in our care. We also use donations to fund awareness programms and events. Every donation counts, and your contribution, large or small, helps us save lives.
